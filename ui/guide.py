This tool takes one of the most tedious data tasks in any business —
classifying every transaction to the right account or category — and does it for
you in seconds, with you staying firmly in control.

You seed a few transactions with the correct **account / category code**, and the
tool propagates those codes to every similar transaction, scores its confidence,
explains its reasoning, and flags anything uncertain for a quick human review.

**What it does for you**

- ⏱️ **Saves hours** every cycle — no more manual search‑copy‑paste in Excel.
- 🎯 **Classifies accurately** — it proposes a code *and* a confidence score for every row.
- 🧠 **Learns from you** — every code you approve makes the next file faster and smarter.
- 🔁 **Repeatable & auditable** — consistent results you can stand behind.

**The big idea:** the more data you run through it, the smarter it gets — and the
richer the insights you can surface about your operation.

4. **Trained model** (an optional AI layer that improves as it learns).

rather than guessed.

**The Review Queue** gathers the rows the tool wasn't fully sure about so you can
make the call quickly:

- Confirm a suggested code with a click, or
- Correct it — type the right code, and the tool remembers.

**Every approval teaches the tool.** Approved codes become **learned memory** and
**training examples**, so the next file is faster and more accurate.

#### Models & learning progress
- The app quietly trains a model in the background as approvals accumulate.
- You can watch progress on the **Models** screen (examples learned, accuracy,
  which engine is active).
- If the model ever underperforms, it **automatically falls back** to the proven
  built-in matcher — you never get worse results by enabling it.

#### Rule Notes — capture the "why"
Add a short **Rule Note** on a tricky transaction (e.g. *"quarterly maintenance
contract"*). These hints improve matching **and** are remembered next time a
similar file comes through.

- **More data, better insight.** The more transactions flow through the tool, the
  richer the picture you can build — spend patterns, vendor trends, and category
  breakdowns that help you understand and improve the business.
- **A premium, repeatable process.** Clean, auditable, consistently coded data
  delivered quickly positions you as the proactive, insight-driven operator.
- **Lower cost to serve.** Hours saved per file means you can handle more volume
