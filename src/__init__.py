"""Core package for Barren Business Development — Transaction Classification.

Modules are deliberately decoupled so each stage of the pipeline can be tested
and extended in isolation:

    data_loader      -> read & normalise transaction files
    similarity       -> embed transactions and group similar ones
    rules_manager    -> persistent keyword -> account-code rules
    fill_down_engine -> orchestrate propagation + confidence scoring
    review_queue     -> surface uncertain rows for human review
    exporter         -> write results back to Excel/CSV
"""
